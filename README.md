Using this library you can easily create and sign transactions for Waves blockchain.
It also allows you to multi-sign existing transactions or create them without signature at all.

This library is a set of transaction constructing functions:

### Transactions

The idea is really simple - you create transaction and sign it from a minimal set of required params.
If you want to create [Transfer transaction](https://wavesplatform.github.io/waves-transactions/interfaces/itransfertransaction.html) the minimum you need to provide is **amount** and **recipient** as defined in [Transfer params](https://wavesplatform.github.io/waves-transactions/interfaces/itransferparams.html):
```js

const { transfer } = require('@waves/waves-transactions')
const seed = 'some example seed phrase'
const signedTranserTx = transfer({ 
  amount: 1,
  recipient: '3P6fVra21KmTfWHBdib45iYV6aFduh4WwC2',
  timestamp: 1536917842558, //Timestamp is optional but it was overrided, in case timestamp is not provided it will fallback to Date.now()

  //Every function from the list above has a set of required and optional params
  //senderPublicKey: 'Cq5itmx4wbYuogySAoUp58MimLLkQrFFLr1tpJy2BYp1', // By default it is derived from seed, 
  // but if you don't want to sign transaction you have to provide it
  //fee: 100000, //Fee is always optional, in case fee is not provided, it will be calculated for you
  //additionalFee: 400000, //If fee is not set, this value will be added to the auto calculated value
  //feeAssetId: undefined
}, seed)
```

Output will be a signed transfer transaction:
```js
{
  id: '8NrUwgKRCMFbUbqXKQAHkGnspmWHEjKUSi5opEC6Havq',
  type: 4,
  version: 2,
  recipient: '3P6fVra21KmTfWHBdib45iYV6aFduh4WwC2',
  attachment: undefined,
  feeAssetId: undefined,
  assetId: undefined,
  amount: 1,
  fee: 100000,
  senderPublicKey: '6nR7CXVV7Zmt9ew11BsNzSvVmuyM5PF6VPbWHW9BHgPq',
  timestamp: 1536917842558,
  proofs: [
    '25kyX6HGjS3rkPTJRj5NVH6LLuZe6SzCzFtoJ8GDkojY9U5oPfVrnwBgrCHXZicfsmLthPUjTrfT9TQL2ciYrPGE'
  ]
}
```

Now you are able to POST it to Waves API or store for future purpose or you can add another signature from other party:
```js
const otherPartySeed = 'other party seed phrase'
const transferSidnedWithTwoParties = transfer(signedTranserTx, seed)
```

So now there are two proofs:
```js
{
  id: '8NrUwgKRCMFbUbqXKQAHkGnspmWHEjKUSi5opEC6Havq',
  type: 4,
  version: 2,
  recipient: '3P6fVra21KmTfWHBdib45iYV6aFduh4WwC2',
  attachment: undefined,
  feeAssetId: undefined,
  assetId: undefined,
  amount: 1,
  fee: 100000,
  senderPublicKey: '6nR7CXVV7Zmt9ew11BsNzSvVmuyM5PF6VPbWHW9BHgPq',
  timestamp: 1536917842558,
  proofs: [
    '25kyX6HGjS3rkPTJRj5NVH6LLuZe6SzCzFtoJ8GDkojY9U5oPfVrnwBgrCHXZicfsmLthPUjTrfT9TQL2ciYrPGE',
    'CM9emPzpe6Ram7ZxcYax6s7Hkw6698wXCMPSckveFAS2Yh9vqJpy1X9nL7p4RKgU3UEa8c9RGXfUK6mFFq4dL9z'
  ]
}
```
